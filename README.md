# Image_Alignment

*Doing image alignment between two images by 3 methods:

1. Lucas-Kanade alignment algorithm
2. (forward) Enhanced correlation coefficient method
3. (inverse) Enhanced correlation coefficient method


*Comparement

2,3 are more robust for global intensity change.
3 is much more faster than 2.
